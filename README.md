# Privacy Sandbox Developer Support

**Summary: ask your Privacy Sandbox developer questions in the [Issues](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/privacy-sandbox-dev-support/issues)!**

You can learn more about the Privacy Sandbox and associated projects at:

* [developer.chrome.com/docs/privacy-sandbox](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/privacy-sandbox)
* [web.dev/digging-into-the-privacy-sandbox](https://web.dev/digging-into-the-privacy-sandbox)
* [chromium.org/Home/chromium-privacy/privacy-sandbox](https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-privacy/privacy-sandbox)
* [privacysandbox.com](https://privacysandbox.com)

These efforts are divided into three main areas:

1. üß∞ Replacing functionality served by cross-site tracking.
2. üç™ Phasing out third-party cookies.
3. üï∂Ô∏è Mitigating workarounds.

As these changes come to the web platform, to Chrome and other browsers,
web developers will have to make changes to your sites. These changes may
take advantage of new APIs or ensure that you take into account new
restrictions.

We aim to land these changes with clear documentation and minimal disruption, but
it's likely you're going to have questions. We're here to try and answer
them! You can raise issues directly in this repo, and we'll also use this as a
location to collate questions and issues we hear from around the ecosystem.

## Process

1. Take a look through the existing [Issues](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/privacy-sandbox-dev-support/issues)
   to see if your issue has already been raised.
2. If not, create a new one! Don't worry about getting it exactly right first time, it's just the start of the discussion.
3. Make sure you read the [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct.md).

We respond to Issues in a number of different ways:

* If your question is best raised as an issue against one of the Privacy Sandbox
  proposals, we'll point you to the right repository and can help you pull together
  the specific details for the issue.
* If your question is actually an implementation issue, we'll point you to the
  relevant component on the browser's bug tracker (it doesn't have to be Chrome!)
  and we can help you get the specific details needed for the issue.
* If your question is already covered by existing documentation, we'll share the docs,
  and will try to understand the reasons why an answer to your question wasn't easily
  discovered or evident in the first place. We'll follow up with documentation updates
  if relevant.
* And, of course, if your question relates to what you need to specifically do
  on your site, then we can help work through a plan with you. We may use
  your question to create the first draft of documentation.

Your question may fall under several of these categories, and we may
separate all those threads with you to get to the answers you need.

## Open Issues in languages other than English

While the primary language for our Developer Relations team is English,
we know that's not the case for all of our developers. We‚Äôlll use our best
effort to understand Issues opened in languages other than English, with
the help of Google Translate. We will copy the translation into our
comment, and respond in English.

If you have further feedback or questions, you can continue to reply to us
in your preferred language, and we‚Äôll follow this same protocol.

## Other channels

The Privacy Sandbox
[Feedback documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/privacy-sandbox/feedback/)
explains where and how to provide feedback for Privacy Sandbox APIs
and proposals throughout the development process.
